Pizza Parlor
========

by Debbie Cravey

Pizza Parlor is a very simple website for a pizza company where a user can go to order a pizza.
The user can enter what size of pizza they want in inches and choose between two toppings.
The website then displays the number of slices that pizza will have based on the diameter of the pizza and the user's topping preference.
